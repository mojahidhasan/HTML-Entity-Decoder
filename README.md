# HTML Entity Decoder

My simple Javascript project made at my very beginning of my web journey when I was new to Javascript.

See live [preview](https://mojahidhasan.github.io/HTML-Entity-Decoder/)

**TODO**:

- Adding named entity instead of number (e.g: `&#60;` instead of `&lt;` for "<"(less than) character)
